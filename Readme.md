## WHAT IS IT?
The general purpose of BEEFOR-ABM is: to model the effect of landscape heterogeneity on foraging movement and the resource-obtaining capacity of bees with different profiles (sizes and sociality). This model is designed to be generic and applicable to several species of pollinator bees, which are defined by some parameters (representing the characteristics required for foraging in the landscape) established in the model interface.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
The ODD protocol will be available in the RLdaSS et al., 2022 thesis of the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil.
We recommend that any publication based on the use of BEEFOR-ABM shall includes, in the Supplementary Material, the NetLogo file itself that was used and all input files. If you change these codes, we recommend documenting the changes in full detail and providing a revised description of the ODD model.

## CREDITS AND REFERENCES
If you mention this model or the NetLogo software in a publication, we ask that you include the citations below. For the model itself: RLdaSS et al., 2022: doctoral thesis from the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil, entitled: Effect of Landscape Heterogeneity on Bee Populations and Communities.
